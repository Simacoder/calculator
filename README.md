# Building a Calculator App

Django is a free and open-source Python web framework that helps you quickly develop secure and maintainable web applications.

## How to Set Up the Django Calculator Project

Assuming that you have Django installed on your system, we will now be working on creating the project. For this, you need to open the terminal and use the following command:

''' bash 
    django-admin startproject calculator
'''

This command creates the project default structure with files like manage.py, and a folder with the project name which contains files like settings.py, urls.py and so on. We will go through those files as we work on our app.
